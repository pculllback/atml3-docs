# Introduction

### Welcome to the realms of ATML3
This site describes the basic functions and commands of the ATML3 programming language. With this handy expression language, you can train an artificial intelligence to write your stuff. All of it.
Just feed it structured data and the ATML3 engine will promptly churn it into a meaningful text in almost no time.
But first off, you will need to tell the text-engine how to text for you. And that is what you do in an ATML3 training.

### Sounds cool, but what can I actually do with it?
Your training contains reasoning: It will tell the text engine how to analyze and map your data. Once trained, the engine can draw conclusions from your data and build a text about them. You can define rules to influence wording, word construction and the appearance of many other aspects in the text ([Properties](#properties) & [Methods](#methods)).
You can also tell the ATML3 engine in what way to mention the information it has concluded from your data ([Sentences](#sentences)).
Once you have your information planned and pinned down, you can do the fine-tuning and have grammar and apply to it ([Containers](#containers) & [Container Parameters](#container_parameters)).
Don't forget microplanning and textplanning. That is also an aspect of ATML3 ([Story Types](#story_types)).

### What else do I need to work with ATML3?
First, you need an account at [my.ax-semantics.com](https://my.ax-semantics.com/) to work with ATML3. Don't worry, it comes for free. Once you have an account, log in, go to your profile page and retrieve your API token there.
You will also need your account unlocked for editing ATML3 and using our wizards. At the moment, you will have to contact us via Live-Chat: just click the speech bubble icon on my.ax-semantics.com and leave us a message. Alternatively you can send us an account request via [Service Desk] (https://aexeagmbh.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7).
Second, you will need one of our editors for ATML3. Choose one among the options at [atml3.rocks](http://atml3.rocks/).
Further, you will need structured data about your topic. If you want to know how to integrate your data into AX, use the API documentation at [apidocs.ax-semantics.com](https://apidocs.ax-semantics.com/).
